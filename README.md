# 3D Portfolio

A 3D portfolio website with an interactive computer! (first draft)

This site was made with react-three-fiber (and a lot of pain)! It's my first foray into 3D web graphics, so definitely a learning experience, but I have plans to expand this to be a more functional portfolio soon!

## coming soon(?)
- more fleshed out website with links to other projects and skills
- interactions with The Cat (site is accurate portrayal of her as I was coding it)
- cool background effects!
- smooth zooming!
